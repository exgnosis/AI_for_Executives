## Customer Experience

Customer Experience (CX) refers to the overall perception that a customer develops of a company based on interactions across all points of contact with the company

A point of contact, often called a "moment of truth" or a "touchpoint," is any interaction between the customer and any aspect of the company such as
- Perceptions of marketing campaigns and the sales process
- Customer support and responsiveness to customer inquiries
- Satisfaction with and ease of use of the product or service
- Proactive actions by the company to meet future customer needs

## Importance of CX

- Increases customer loyalty and retention
- Enhances brand reputation and market differentiation
- Boosts customer lifetime value (CLV)
- Drives positive word-of-mouth and referrals

## Key Components of CX

- _Customer Journey Mapping_ – Identification and optimization of each touchpoint in the customer's experience with the company over time
- _Omnichannel Experience_ – Ensuring consistency across different channels of contact like the company website, social media, physical stores and apps
- _Personalization_ – Tailoring the CX to individual customer preferences
- _Customer Support & Service_ – Providing efficient and responsive customer service through multiple support channels that support the customer preference; for example,  phone, live chat with a human, email, AI chatbots

## Challenges of Traditional CX

- The amount of effort required to personalize the touchpoints and being consistent in the CX has been a major challenge for companies
- In theory, it's a great idea, but in practice, it's very difficult and expensive to implement
- According to Forbes, CX efforts routinely struggle with:
  - Long wait times, either on hold or navigating IVR systems
  - Repetitive information requests, where the customer must provide the same details multiple times
  - Multiple transfers between agents or departments before reaching a resolution
  - A lack of consistency in service, resulting in varied outcomes depending on the agent or system involved
