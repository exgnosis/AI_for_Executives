# Planning for AI Implementation

## Understanding AI Readiness

AI readiness is the ability of an organization to successfully adopt and scale AI.

AI readiness is made of several different components 
- _Data Readiness_ – Does the organization have clean, structured, and accessible data?
- _Technology Readiness_ – Does the organization have the necessary AI infrastructure, cloud computing, and integration capabilities?
- _Talent Readiness_ – Does the organization have skilled personnel or need to upskill/hire AI experts?
- _Cultural Readiness_ – Are employees open to AI adoption and process automation?

## Maturity Models

Maturity models are used to benchmark how well an organization has integrated and masted the processes required to succeed in a business area. Maturity models typically identify four stages of mastery
1. _Initial_: Processes are not defined. Activities are not planned, being ad hoc and reactive. Capabilities are undefined. Without controls, results are unpredictable.
2. _Repeatable_: Basic project management is in place. Processes are starting to emerge and key performance indicators (KPIs) are used. Outcomes are identified, with predictable and consistent results achieved.
3. _Defined_: Documented and standardized processes are aligned with organizational goals. Team members get training, have guidelines, and work toward metrics to ensure consistent results.
4. _Managed_: Measurements and controls are fully developed with a data-driven approach for continuous improvement.
5. _Optimized_: Processes are well-defined, tested, and efficient. The focus is on innovation, resilience, and adaptability.

## Gartner's AI Maturity Model

There are other models but Gartner's is a typical example.

**Level 1. Awareness**
- Companies in this stage know about AI but haven’t quite used it yet. 
- These companies may be excited to implement AI 
- They often speak more of it than they know. 
- They formulate ideas, but not strategies, for how to use AI in their businesses.

**Level 2. Active**
- These companies are playing with AI informally. 
- They are experimenting with AI in Jupyter notebooks, and they may have implemented a few models from the various libraries into their processes.

**Level 3. Operational**
- These companies have adopted machine learning into their day-to-day functions. 
- Likely, they have a team of ML engineers. 
- They could be maintaining models or creating data pipelines or versioning data. 
- They have the ML infrastructure set up, and they are using ML to assist with some information processing tasks—hence the Artificial Information Processing approach to measuring value.

**Level 4. Systemic**
- These companies are using machine learning in a novel way to disrupt business models. 
- Often, hype at the awareness stage can say that they are disruptive, but the difference between a Level 1 and a Level 4 company is that the Level 4 company has feet on the ground, with the ML infrastructure in place.

**Level 5. Transformational**
- Companies at this level of Gartner’s data maturity model use ML pervasively. 
- Machine learning and information processing is the value offering towards their customers.
